                                        The user stories for the pre apply is basically everything we need to do before applying for a job which are resume,
                                        cover letter and social media platforms(LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed etc). For the post apply user stories we did our
                                        project stories like what did we  actually do? which brings us to the 5W1H(When, Where, What, Why, Who and How).
                                        We also did our Artificial Intelligent(AI) which aid our application process.</p>

                                        efforts to enhance job application materials, improve qualifications, and increase chances of securing desired positions.
                                        By adopting a sprint hardening mindset, we optimize application materials, expand networks, and continuously improve strategies.
